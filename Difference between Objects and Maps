1- Construction 

// Object literals are the simplest way to create the object
const users = {
  1: 'Nitesh',
  2: 'Chaubey'
}

//Maps are created using built-in "Map" constructor
const users = new Map([
  [1, 'Nitesh'],
  [2, 'Chaubey']
])

2- Objects are the collection of key-value pairs but the key can only be a string.
While key of a "Map" can be of any type.

3- Maps preserve the order of keys, where objects do not

4- Maps offer nicer interface for accessing the entries
  - get(key)
  - has(key)
  - hasOwnProperty(key)
  - set(key, value)
  - delete(key)
  - size()
  
5- JSON offers support for objects but not for maps
